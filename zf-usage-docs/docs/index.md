# What is the Zebrafish Facility Manager?

The Zebrafish Facility Manager is a software package for maintaining information about zebrafish 
stocks used in a genetics research lab.

It is a web application that can be used on virtually any modern
phone, tablet or computer with no installation required.

## Tracking Features

ZFM tracks zebrafish stocks in a research facility including:

- the lineage of their stocks
- the genetic markers (mutations and transgenes) carried by each stock
- the lineage of those markers
- where the stocks are physically located in the fish facility
- various notes and data associated with the stock (age, researchers, research notes...)
- the various transgenes and mutations in use at the facility
  
## Operational Features

ZFM supports normal research processes including:

- creation of new stocks from crosses using existing stocks
- creation of sub-stocks for subgroups of a stock that have been identified as genetically distinct  
- search and filtering of stocks using a multitude of criteria
- navigation up and down stock lineages
- printing neat and accurate tank labels

## Additional Features

ZFM is integrated with ZFIN so that detailed information about
mutations and transgenes is always accessible with a quick click.

The system provides reporting and auditing tools that are particularly useful for animal
husbandry tasks.

The system applies internal
checks and controls to help users keep their data clean and consistent.
