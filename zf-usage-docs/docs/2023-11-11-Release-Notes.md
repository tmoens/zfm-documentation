# November 11, 2023 - Release Notes

In this release we are happy to announce a few new features for our customers.

## Cross Maker

We have made the process of creating a new stock from two existing stock 
much easier.  You can use the Cross Maker to choose two parents from the 
filtered stock list.  When you "Make a Cross" you can edit the details of 
the new stock.  Which leads to...

## Major Stock Editor Improvements

You can now edit all aspects of the stock in one screen! So, parents, 
mutations, transgenes and swimmers can all be done at once.
We hope this provides an improved user experience.

## Multiple Mutation and Transgene Filters

In some labs, stocks have multiple mutations and transgenes and a filter for 
a single mutation and a single transgene was not narrowing the search for 
stocks quite enough.
So we introduced the ability to search for an unlimited 
number of mutations and transgenes at once.  

## Loose definition of "alive"

The system continues to define a stock as living if it is in a tank. That is,
it has "swimmers".
For some labs, this is inconvenient. They prefer to be able to designate a 
stock as alive whether they have told the system it is in a tank.  If 
your lab prefers this approach, we can configure the system to see things 
your way.

## Fixes and Minor Enhancements

We found there were a few things that were a little suboptimal, so we fixed 
them:

- filtering on stock ages sometimes caused inaccurate filtering results, 
   especially in combination with other filters, this has been fixed.

- the "Tank Walker" feature was not working perfectly and has been fixed.

- the "Facility Audit App" has been improved

- the Export Tool now provides a little more information (such as the PI 
   who owns the stocks in each tank).

- Much, much more has been done under the covers to keep the ZFM software 
   up to date with changes in the software world.  

## Problems?

While we have done our best to make sure the software will be bug free and 
easy to use, there may well be errors or problems.  If things are not 
working well for you or you think they should be better, we invite your 
feedback to zebrafishfacilitymanager@gmail.com.
