## Customer Responsibilities:

### User Management:

ZFM empowers the Customer with the capability to manage their own Users,
thereby making access control the sole responsibility of the Customer. It is the
Customer's duty to ensure that access privileges are granted judiciously and
that user
management is conducted diligently.

### Compliance with Institutional Rules:

The Customer warrants that they will manage their users in strict accordance
with
any rules, guidelines, and regulations of their respective institutions or
affiliating organizations. Any non-compliance or misuse may result in sanctions
or repercussions as deemed appropriate by the Provider.

### Intended Use:

The Customer agrees and warrants that they will use ZFM exclusively for its
designated and
intended purpose. Any deviation from the intended application of ZFM may lead to
action, up to and including the termination of services.

### Legal Compliance:

The Customer warrants that they will not use ZFM to store, transmit, or manage
any information or data that infringes on copyrights, proprietary rights, or
violates any applicable local, state, national, or international laws. The
Customer
will be held liable for any consequences, legal or otherwise, that arise from
such
violations.

### Limited Storage of Personal Information:

While ZFM requires the storage of minimal personal information such as user
names, email addresses, and phone numbers for operational purposes (e.g.,
sending password reset messages), the Customer is strictly prohibited from
using ZFM to store any additional personal data without a clear operational
necessity. This includes, but is not limited to, social security numbers,
financial information, or any other sensitive data that can be used to identify
an individual beyond the system's operational requirements.

Unless explicitly permitted by law and with necessary security measures in
place, the Customer must refrain from storing excessive personal information on
ZFM. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the responsibility for any
breach, loss, or violation arising from the unauthorized or excessive storage of
personal information rests solely with the Customer.

## Provider Services:

The Provider is responsible for supplying the ZFM system to the Customer and
their Users subject to disclaimers outlined below.

### Data Backups:

The Provider will carry out backups of the customer’s data on a daily,
weekly, and monthly basis.
The Provider will back up Customer’s data in SQL format:

- **Monthly backups** are retained for a minimum of one year.

### Raw Data Availability:

The provider allows the Customer to retrieve a full copy of their data in
Workbook format through the ZFM system.

request.

## Data Safety Disclaimer:

The Provider makes no guarantees or warranties regarding the safety,
security, integrity, or loss of Customer’s data.
The Customer accepts the risk associated with potential data loss, and the
Provider holds no liability for any data loss or corruption that may occur.

### Provider Mittigation of Risk

The Provider mitigates this risk by backing up the Customer's data as
described above.
