# Migrating Data

When a new lab comes on line, they usually have a ton of data in 
any form
from a Filemaker Pro database to - wait for it - a single copy of 
a handwritten notebook first created by monks in AD 1347.

And we have to get it all into the database as quickly and 
efficiently as possible.

So here are some notes

TODO Adda reference to a migrationworkbook, how to find it and blah blah.

TODO Add a note about the Import tool, how to activate it and how to turn it
off in production.
