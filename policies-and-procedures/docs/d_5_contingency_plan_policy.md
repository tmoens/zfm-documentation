## Contingency Plan Policy

Draft 1.0

Issued TBD

Last Updated and Approved TBD

### Purpose

Establish, maintain, and effectively implement a Contingency Plan for
emergency response, backup operations, and post-disaster recovery for
ZFM systems to ensure the availability of critical
information resources and continuity of operations in emergency situations.

A security contingency is an event with the potential to disrupt operations,
thereby disrupting mission critical functions. Such an event could be a power
outage, hardware or software failure, software compromise (e.g., from malicious
hacking, viruses, or worms), fire, or storm. Contingency planning and procedures
are required to provide reasonable assurance that critical data processing
support can be sustained or quickly restored if normal system operations are
interrupted

### Scope

system and its customers.

understood, tested and implemented by appropriate staff.

### Contingency Plan Implementation
