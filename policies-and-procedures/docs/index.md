# Zebrafish Facility Manager Policies and Procedures

This set of policies and procedures came into being as part of a security audit done to
allow deployment of the Zebrafish Facility Manager into the National Institute of Health.

Completion of the audit will ideally yield "Authority to Operate" in United States Government
zebrafish research facilities.
